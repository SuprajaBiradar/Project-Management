# 🧑‍💼 Employee-Admin Task Dashboard

A fully functional **React JS** application that simulates a multi-role task management system using `localStorage` for data persistence. This beginner-friendly project is part of a MERN Stack learning series and focuses on the **frontend (React)** portion of full-stack development.

## 📘 Project Description

The **Employee-Admin Task Dashboard** allows two types of users — **Admins** and **Employees** — to interact with a task management interface.

- **Admins** can:
  - Create and assign tasks
  - View all employee data
  - Manage task information

- **Employees** can:
  - View assigned tasks
  - Track task progress

The app is built using **React Hooks**, **Context API**, and **react-router-dom** for routing. Data is stored and retrieved using **localStorage**, simulating a backend-less environment. It’s ideal for learners who want to practice frontend development without needing a database or server.

## 🚀 Features

- Role-based login simulation (Admin & Employee)
- Context API for global state management
- Task creation and assignment
- Route protection based on user role
- Data persistence using `localStorage`
- Logout and session handling

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React JS
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: useState, useContext
- **Persistence**: localStorage
- **Styling**: CSS or Tailwind (as per project setup)
